I couldn't figure out how to show liquidity over time on dexscreener, so welcome to liquid, a flexible real time data viewer for dex info based on the dexscreener API.

Check it out [here](liquid-omega.vercel.app)

## Usage

Get the token address for the pair you're interested in then go!

## Roadmap

Pair explorer

More advanced graph features (very basic atm)

Graph desync (different tokens on different graph, independant time series and movement)

Use pair or token address (currently only token address)

More data options 

More display options (candlestick, tables for table data)
